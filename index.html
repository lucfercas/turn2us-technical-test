        <h2>What Does Universal Credit Cover?</h2>
        <p>
          Universal Credit is a financial support system for individuals and
          families with low income or those out of work. It helps with your
          daily living costs and can assist with housing, childcare expenses,
          and health-related costs. This single monthly payment is designed to
          simplify your benefit support, adapting as your circumstances change
          to ensure you always have the assistance you need.
